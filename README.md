# Mega Mix Thumbnail Manager

Automatically manage the thumbnails of the songs in Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA
Mega Mix+. This mod will generate a unified thumbnail database for all songs
from the base game and your installed mods, so none of your songs will have
broken thumbnails (hopefully).

## Usage

Put the mod in your `mods` folder and depending on your setup, either:

- Make sure it's the first mod in the file list, if you don't use the priority
  line.
- Make sure it's the first mod in your priority line, if you use it.

Then just run the game as usual. The mod will do its magic when the game starts.
